        <h1>Some interesting facts about Sun</h1>
        <p>
          The Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider
          than Jupiter, the biggest planet.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our
          solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together.
          Everything in our solar system revolves around it – the planets,
          asteroids, comets, and tiny bits of space debris.
        </p>
        <p>
          Measuring a “day” on the Sun is complicated. The Sun is made of
          super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates
          at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the
          Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun
          rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The part of the Sun we see from Earth – the part we call the surface –
          is the photosphere. The Sun doesn’t actually have a solid surface
          because it’s a ball of plasma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above the Sun’s surface are its thin chromosphere and the huge corona
          (crown). This is where we see features such as solar prominences,
          flares, and coronal mass ejections. The latter two are giant
          explosions of energy and particles that can reach Earth.

        <h1>Some interesting facts about Mercury</h1>
        <p>
          The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,
          Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of
          Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it
          does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as
          seven times brighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold.
          Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach
          highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at
          night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in
          our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its
          dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around
          the Sun every 88 Earth days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The
          temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are
          most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled
          swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the
          Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core,
          a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.

        <h1>Some interesting facts about Venus</h1>
        <p>
          Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and our closest planetary
          neighbor. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, and is
          sometimes called Earth's twin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes
          called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway
          greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system
          with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense,
          persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky:
          the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets: Mercury, Venus,
          Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named the objects after their most
          important gods. Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love
          and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most
          features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named
          after a female god.
        </p>
        <p>
          Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the
          solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the
          innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon
          dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and
          Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the
          hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But
          higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Venus orbits the Sun from an average distance of 67 million miles (108
          million kilometers), or 0.72 astronomical units. One astronomical unit
          (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
          distance, it takes sunlight about six minutes to travel from the Sun
          to Venus.

        <h1>Some interesting facts about Earth</h1>
        <p>
          Earth isn’t actually round. While this sounds like an elaborate joke,
          we’re actually serious. Earth isn’t flat, but it’s not perfectly round
          either. Earth’s rotation causes the planet to bulge at the equator and
          flatten at the poles, while the distribution of mass on Earth (which
          is not perfectly uniform) causes small variations in the gravitational
          pull at different locations on the planet. These variations are too
          small to be seen in pictures of Earth from space, so it appears round
          to the human eye.

          Coral reefs are Earth’s largest living structure. Coral reefs are not
          only beautiful natural wonders, but also the largest living structure
          on Earth. These underwater ecosystems are made up of colonies of tiny
          animals called coral polyps, which build calcium carbonate skeletons
          that accumulate over time and form the complex structures we know as
          coral reefs. Coral reefs are incredibly diverse and play a vital role
          in the ocean ecosystem, providing habitat and protection for many
          species, and acting as a natural barrier that helps to protect
          coastlines from storms and erosion.

          Antarctica is home to the largest ice sheet on Earth. More than six
          times as large as Greenland, Antarctica is the southernmost continent
          and is the coldest and windiest place on Earth – with temperatures
          that can drop as low as -89.2°C and winds that can exceed 320 km per
          hour. Antarctica is home to the largest ice sheet on Earth, containing
          a staggering 30 million cubic kilometres of ice. This represents an
          incredible 70% of Earth's freshwater and 90% of its ice. As a result,
          changes to the Antarctic ice sheet can have significant implications
          for global sea levels and ocean currents.

          The Moon is drifting away from Earth. You read that correctly! The
          Moon is gradually drifting away from Earth at a rate of approximately
          4 cm per year. This phenomenon is caused by the Moon pulling on
          Earth’s oceans creating tidal forces that produce a bulge of water on
          the side of Earth facing the Moon.

        <h1>Some interesting facts about Mars</h1>
        <p>
          Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert world
          with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar
          ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.

          Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's
          the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
          NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter
          and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago. Mars was
          named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was
          reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning
          "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet"
          because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing
          the surface to look red.

          Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on
          Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long
          ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5
          billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and
          dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half
          the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a
          central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.

        <h1>Some interesting facts about Jupiter</h1>
        <p>
          Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar
          system – if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside.
          It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over
          from the Sun's formation 4.5 billion years ago. But it has the
          shortest day in the solar system, taking only 10.5 hours to spin
          around once on its axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds
          of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and
          helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the lighter
          bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite
          directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger
          than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. The king of planets
          was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of
          its moons are also named for mythological characters, figures
          associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus.

          Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it.
          The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this
          planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt
          to. While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to
          take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is
          one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar
          system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust,
          where life could possibly be supported.

        <p>
          Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system about 4.5
          billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to
          form this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the
          formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined
          material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact, Jupiter has
          the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to
          ignite. About 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current
          position in the outer solar system, where it is the fifth planet from
          the Sun.
